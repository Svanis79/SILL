# SILL
The Semi-Intelligent Language Lerner - version 2.0

Warning! This code is a mess!
Danger, Will Robinson! Danger!
Any attempt to read and make sense of this code may very well result in a brain aneurysm and should only be attempted by those willing to risk their lives to understand the sick mind that created this program. You'll never find a more wretched hive of bugs and unused functions!

If you still want to take a peek behind the scenes, have fun! :-)
